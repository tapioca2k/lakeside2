# Lakeside2
Lakeside2 is a tile-based RPG engine written in C# with MonoGame. When completed, it will be powerful enough to enable a mostly non-technical user to create their own retro RPGs and adventure games.

The name Lakeside2 derives from an older engine, Lakeside, which aimed to accomplish the same job and was intended to be used to make a fishing adventure game ala Legend of the River King. It was essentially feature-complete, but heavily burdened by technical debt. The goal of Lakeside 2 is to create a more sustainable codebase that does not fall into the same pitfalls.
